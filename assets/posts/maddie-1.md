When Maddie Stone was named to the [2020 WIRED25][2020WIRED25] list of people "standing between us and species collapse", they wrote a little blurb about her.
It makes a pretty good starting point for any article gushing about her:

> After ­considering­ careers in interior design and with the FBI as a teenager, Stone was coaxed into pursuing a degree in engineering by her father.
> Now, as part of Project Zero, she’s been hunting the bugs hiding in Silicon ­Valley’s code.
> In the wild, these pests are known as zero-day vulnerabilities, and they can wreak havoc when exploited by hackers.

They also add that she's "climbed Mount Kilimanjaro and has read over 80 books this year."

Of course, that's only a summary.
So let's go into some detail!

## Project Zero

[Project Zero], P0 for short, is a Google project to find zero-day vulnerabilities.
That is, a vuln which the developer of the software wasn't aware of, and there's no patch for yet -- in other words, which has been patched for zero days.
P0's goal is to find these 0days by looking at malware, reverse-engineering high-value targets, and more.

I'll be honest, it's hard to talk about Stone's contributions there.
First, P0 doesn't exactly break down exactly who contributes where, as far as I can tell.
That's a good thing: You don't want to shame new members of the team, or make people on an unlucky streak feel bad.
Second, while she happily talks about her mistakes, she rarely talks about her successes.

We can make some educated guesses, though.
She's clearly an extremely good reverse engineer, specializing in Android.
She knows a lot about that ecosystem and malware in it, and has talked about breaking Android systems a bunch.
So I feel pretty confident assuming that she's found a bunch of 0days in Android and various apps, and constantly helps her teammates with it.

## Talks

Most of [Stone's talks][talks] are abouther work on Project Zero.
That makes sense: it's really cool, and who wouldn't want to talk about it?
She's done half a dozen amazing talks 
But, of course, that's hardly _all_ she talks about.

Most of the rest of her talks are about Android, one way or another.
From her talk at Kaspersky SAS 2019 about an Android botnet to
