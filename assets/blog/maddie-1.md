Today is the first in a hopefully long, but likely irregular series I'm gonna call Shoutouts.
Long story short, some people get way too much shit, called incompentent, and harassed over existing.
It was inspired by [a tweet by Maddie Stone][1], saying she got emails, telling blatant lies like that she's "unskilled" or "not technical".

(The #1 at the end of the title is because I expect to write a successor at some point)
