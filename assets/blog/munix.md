µnix (or munix, if you can't type µ) is an RTOS and HAL, inspired by FreeRTOS,
but designed to be used for secure realtime applications. It requires minimal
overhead per thread, and offers a wide variety of functions to securely handle
data, as much as the platform allows. Source code can be shared easily between
platforms with µnix support, with compile-time failures if features are needed
but not available.

TODO: More explanation! Why I picked it for the blog, where its docs are,
etc.
