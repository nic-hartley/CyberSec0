HeartPinePhone is a project of mine.
I could give you the fancy pitch, but that's all in [the README] anyway, if you really care.
Long story short: HPP is an OS for PinePhone that you can trust.
It's also, admittedly, mostly just a pet project, because I like writing low-level code.
What you'll read here are the posts chronicling my journey through developing it.
I'm hoping this eventually becomes a roughly weekly thing, but we'll see how life treats me.

One important note is that these posts are very much meant for me.
You might find them interesting, even educational, and I'll probably word them as though they're tutorials.
All the same, I'm not going to put much effort into actually making them good, educational content.
They're just an irregular log of my progress on a pet project.
Tame your expectations now.
