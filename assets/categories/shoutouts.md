Shoutouts are blog posts about people who do cool stuff.
They're an attempt to balance out a little bit of the harassment that the people get.
When someone gets called "not technical enough", I write up a list of all the cool shit they've done.
When someone gets called "a quota hire", I point out all the ways they've helped people.
When someone's manager is emailed with lies, I rebut with all the truthful praise I can muster.

Shoutouts are not objective.
They're not biographies.
They're singing the praises of people who get harassed over bullshit.
I hope they offset the pain a little bit.

If you've got an idea for somone who deserves a Shoutout about them, [let me know](/contact)!
If you disagree, feel free to make your opinion known by writing it and putting it in [one of these][round-file]!
And finally, if you think I missed something important:
Write your own!
The point of these is to show support for people who get unfairly demonized.
The more individuals who do it, the better!
