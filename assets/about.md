Nic Hartley is about to graduate college, and is going into infosec.

He'd write more, but he has no reason to yet.

## Contact info

No matter how you get in touch, please be explicitly clear about why
you're doing it. I can be, and usually am, oblivious. If you want help, be
sure to be clear about your problem. If you want mentorship, be clear
about what subject.

If you've found a bug or want a change in any of my projects on GitHub,
please use their respective GitHub issues. It's much easier to track
progress there than in my email.

Likewise, if you have an issue with this site, please submit an issue to
[its repo][this-repo].

The best and most reliable way to get in touch with me personally is by
email: [nic@cybers.eco][my-email]. Failing that,
my [Twitter][my-twitter] DMs are always
open. That email is powered by ProtonMail, so you can probably trust it.

Finally, I do have a phone number and a Discord. However, I don't give out
either publicly, and I have my DMs closed on Discord. If you'd like to use
either of those platforms, email me, and we can talk about it. Expect me
to be suspicious of or outright hostile to the idea, though.
