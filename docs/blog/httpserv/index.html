  <p>httpserv is a <a href="https://crates.io/crates/httpserv">published</a> HTTP fileserver. It's meant to be a tiny,
easy-to-install, easy-to-use fileserver for local development of static sites.
In that regard, it succeeds wonderfully:</p>
<ul>
<li>Installation is simple. All you need is <a href="https://rustup.rs/">Rustup</a>, which is easy to install,
and then it takes one command and under a minute to install httpserv.</li>
<li>Usage is equally easy. To serve the current directory, all you need is
<code>httpserv</code> (or <code>httpserv.exe</code>, on WSL) and you're serving those files over
localhost. If you want to serve another directory, <code>httpserv /path/to/dir</code>
will do it.</li>
<li>Because of its simplicity, httpserv starts up almost instantly, and serves
requests within a millisecond or two. That makes it extremely responsive,
even when you need to serve dozens of files.</li>
</ul>
<p>httpserv is already fairly mature. It serves files as intended, and as quickly
as I want it to. It only has a couple more bugfixes before the 1.0 release.
Once that happens, I'll start releasing precompiled executables, to simplify
installation even further -- just drag-and-drop the executable onto your PATH.</p>
