  <p>Shoutouts are blog posts about people who do cool stuff.
They're an attempt to balance out a little bit of the harassment that the people get.
When someone gets called &quot;not technical enough&quot;, I write up a list of all the cool shit they've done.
When someone gets called &quot;a quota hire&quot;, I point out all the ways they've helped people.
When someone's manager is emailed with lies, I rebut with all the truthful praise I can muster.</p>
<p>Shoutouts are not objective.
They're not biographies.
They're singing the praises of people who get harassed over bullshit.
I hope they offset the pain a little bit.</p>
<p>If you've got an idea for somone who deserves a Shoutout about them, <a href="/contact">let me know</a>!
If you disagree, feel free to make your opinion known by writing it and putting it in <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Bin.JPG">one of these</a>!
And finally, if you think I missed something important:
Write your own!
The point of these is to show support for people who get unfairly demonized.
The more individuals who do it, the better!</p>
