Everything commented out is going to be published eventually!
I just need to write some content for them first.
- [The shoutouts](/shoutouts):
  Short, semi-regular pieces focusing on the cool things done by people who get targeted with harassment regularly.
  Whether they're a woman whose managed was emailed saying they're "not technical" enough to be in infosec,
  a person of color being told they look unprofessional for wearing their hair in cornrows,
  or a queer person impolitely informed that they were just a diversity hire,
  I'm listing all the cool shit people have done.
  I hope it cheers them up!
  I also hope to highlight the achievements of people who, frankly, don't get anywhere near as much credit as they should.
- [ARM TrustZone Tutorials](/trustzone):
  Have you ever wanted to know how ARM TrustZone works?
  Do you want to design with it, but you can't find any good overviews?
  Then start here!
  It's a gentle introduction to TrustZone for people with a basic knowledge of embedded development.
  If you understand MMIO and Assembly well enough to write bare-metal code, you'll do just fine.
  (If you're looking to <em>hack</em> it, I recommend [Azeria's tutorials][azeria-trustzone]!)
- [HeartPinePhone](/hpp):
  One of my favorite projects, HeartPinePhone is an alternative open-source kernel for PinePhones.
  It focuses on security, privacy, and user control, to the exclusion of almost everything else.
  It makes use of the HeartPinePhone's hardware design and ARM TrustZone to
  isolate apps,
  ensure users have ultimate control,
  and keep apps away from information they shouldn't have.
- [Creative writing](/fiction):
  I do some writing sometimes.
  Sometimes I'll publish vignettes that I use to nail down characters.
  Sometimes they'll just be fight scenes with no further context.
  Maybe they'll be lore or worldbuilding notes, or even snippets of in-universe books!
- [The demos](/demos):
  Showcases of various different types of browser-based attacks.
  None of these are zero-days, or even really <em>vulnerabilities</em>.
  They're just common techniques to do malicious things to users.
