    Welcome to CyberSec0!
  </h1>
  <h2>Site Guide</h2>
  <p>
    Not sure where to go? Most of the content on this site is in two places:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <a href="/blog">The blog</a>, which is a standard tech-focused blog.
      It's also the development blog for a few personal projects:
      <a href="/blog/munix">µnix</a>, <a href="/blog/mesher">mesher</a>, and
      <a href="/blog/httpserv">httpserv</a>. When not blogging about those
      projects, I blog about whatever random things interest me: cryptography,
      cyberwarfare, embedded programming, and information warfare. Ask me
      about algorithms sometime.
    </li>
    <li>
      My <a href="/demos">demos</a>, which explain, show off, or simulate a
      bunch of types of attacks, like tab hijacking and buffer overflows.
      Please note I <em>do not</em> drop 0days as demos. If you think I have,
      please <a href="/contact">get in touch</a> ASAP.
    </li>
    <!--
      An in-progress puzzle! If you want to take a sneak peek, see /puzzle
      But be aware -- it's /very/ in-progress. It'll be linked here once
      it's done. (Probably around February 2020)
    -->
  </ul>
  <h2>History</h2>
  <p>
    CyberSec0 was 'founded' as part of taking a joke too far.
  </p>
  <p>
    <a href="/bios/nic">I</a> was looking at domain names, specifically
    cybersecurity-related ones, and noticed that <code>cybers.eco</code> was
    available. I thought about it for a bit, realized I'd been meaning to make
    a blog anyway, and decided that I may as well host it there. It's not like
    I had anything else I'd be using this domain for, after all.
  </p>
  <p>
    But even after deciding to write a blog, I still had to find something to
    blog <em>about</em>. That's where <a href="/blog/munix">µnix</a>
    comes in: It's easy to describe, but contains a ton of complexity that'll
    be fun to explore, and give me plenty of material to write about.
  </p>
  <h2>Technical info</h2>
  <p>
    This site is run on GitHub Pages. The HTML pages served are generated by
    <a href="://github.com/nic-hartley/CyberSec0">a bit of janky Rust</a>, and
    deployed with a <code>git push</code>.
  </p>
  <p>
    All the HTML and CSS was written by <a href="/bios/nic">Nic</a>, though of course with
    plenty of bits and pieces of help from others.
